Done:
-Find usb and select
-parser for usbalyzer xml and searcher
-get usb device info
-create gadgetfs ( needs more cleaning )
-release the device, clean up and attach to kernel
-proxy with sniffer
-We now have a enumeration of all the interfaces and endpoints of the device we need to be able to use it
-added the clones to a flat files via json much cleaner and better ...
- We have several hid reports now dependant on the usb device , when setting up GadgetFS ensure the user is presented with
    options to choose which hid report to be passed to the gadget.
-Setup GadgetFS method should only create a bashfile and push it to the Pi Zero and then execute it.
- you can detaches specific interfaces  and detach each from the kernel.
-added a thread monitor to listen on interface changes
-Piped the sniff method to a pesudo terminal /dev/pts/X not to clog ipython :)
-detach the interfaces from the kernel driver inside the findselect() Method it will be better if we didnt blacklist the device driver
-rabbitMQ is configured see Installations section
-when coming to do the comms use Queue() so we can communicate directly to the thread
-push bash file for gadgetfs to raspberrypi over ssh
-add a method for ctrl transfers
-simulate device or host by pushing to a Pi zero
-send custom messages to the host queue
-send messages to device or host with ability to manipulate the payload
-support for HID
-replay msg or whole communication from usblyzer db


TODO:
- add parse args to pizerorouter so you can input the max packet size
-add support in MITMwifi() to select between bulk or control transfer
-when we present the endpoints and its interfaces it will be more user friendly to show if the endpoint is in or out
-fuzzer method
-tutorial
-Add support for Mass storage and NDIS devices
-Parse the usb packets 



Questions can cancelations:
-is it possible to make DMA calls (getting physical with USB Type-C) ?
